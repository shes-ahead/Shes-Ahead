## About

I study how complex systems behave under pressure.

My work focuses on identifying pattern shifts before they surface,
modeling behavioral drift across structured environments,
and designing architectures that remain stable as conditions change.

I am interested in what happens beneath visible outcomes.

## Areas of Interest

- Pattern transition analysis  
- Structural drift  
- Adaptive system modeling  
- Signal extraction under uncertainty  
- Stability architecture  
- Long-horizon system design  

---

## Approach

- Precision over visibility  
- Structure over narrative  
- Resilience over reaction  
- Long-term design over short-term gain

## Connect

If you’re building in finance, systems research, or AI infrastructure —  
I’m always open to thoughtful conversations.
